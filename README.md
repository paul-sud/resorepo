REcursively Search On remote REPO

If you're like me, you often need to search through other people's code on GitHub, but only need to do it a couple of times. Usually this involves cloning, searching for what I need with ripgrep, and deleting the directory when I'm done. This utility allows you to use the full ripgrep functionality on any remote repository

Requires `rg` installed and on your path.
